# ngrx-demo
This is an ultra-light demo/sample for ngrx (https://ngrx.io/) implementation with use of @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/router-store and @ngrx/store-devtool.

I did this to learn about NGRX, such a great library and convinced me Redux can be a nice choice depending on project.

## Run
Run 
``
npm install
``
then 
``
ng serve
``.
See 
``

## What happened ?
You can see multiples actions like : ask data ( GET_CATEGORIES ) and recieve data (GET_CATEGORIES_SUCCESS), a simple way to use Effects, reducer, selector and use of angular routes in redux way.

### Style
I'm about reworking style...
